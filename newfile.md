# sourdough
- starting
	- feed 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup water for a week
- maintenance
	- feed *once* weekly and place in fridge if not in use
	- if in use, pull out the night or two nights before and feed once or twice accordingly
- benefits
	- sourdough is great as some believe the community consumes some of the harder to digest wheat compounds, including phytate
		- sourdough contains live cultures of multiple species from different kingdoms, and may serve as a "probiotic" as traditionally known in the supplement community
